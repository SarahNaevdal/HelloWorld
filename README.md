# Project Instructions
Follow the instructions here: https://vuxcode.netlify.app/new/pr1/lessons/major-project-brief/

REMEMBER TO "COMMIT" YOUR CHANGES REGULARLY TO SHOW HOW YOU HAVE BUILT THIS PROJECT! 

The final program is not the goal! The aim of the project is to show how you have developed your program, the steps you have taken and the problems you have solved!

# Project Summary

My idea was to code an interactiv book with two different options for the user to choose from on each page. That part with all different paths was the absolutley hardest task for me to solve. I spent several hours trying to find a soulution, both testing and searching on the internet. Since it felt like I might not solve this problem I eventually decided to move on in the program. When finished some other things I found a way that worked, but not without some problems on the way. It felt good to finally have something to work with. I wanted to do everything in the 'right' order, fixing the fundamental things first, but I had to leave that part for a while and come back whenever I had thought of or found a new idea how to solve it. 

Now the book works but there are still some things I would have tried to fix if there was time. For example: Have the book read by itself like an audiobook (the user should still use the buttons), add a book-cover, add descriptions of each character, remove the empty space that appears after on top of each page after hiding the headline. Solve the problem with showing the wrong button-text in the console. It would also be cool to have the user create a character that looked like them and it could be in the book. 

I started using almost nothing but what we learned in class but ended up with more and more other  codes aswell. I learned so much and had som much fun doing this class and project.  



# User Guide

The program is customized for children so I have been trying to make it as simple to use as possible. There is a instruction for the text-box and also one for the 'Start' button, the rest of the buttons have text on that helps the user to understand how to use them.
